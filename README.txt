# 🧠 SonarPredictorAI

**SonarPredictorAI** is a machine learning web app that predicts whether a sonar signal corresponds to a **Rock** 🪨 or a **Mine** 🚢.  

This is my first end-to-end ML project — from training the model to building an interactive web interface using **Streamlit**. It was a fun and challenging learning experience!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – for data processing  
- **Scikit-learn** – to train the classification model  
- **Pickle** – to save and load the trained model  
- **Streamlit** – to create the web UI  
- **GitHub + Streamlit Cloud** – for hosting

## 📊 About the Dataset

This project uses the [Sonar dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+sonar+mines+vs+rocks), which contains sonar readings that bounce off either rocks or mines.

## 🙌 What I Learned

- Training and evaluating ML models using scikit-learn  
- Saving models with Pickle  
- Creating user interfaces with Streamlit  
- Deploying an ML model to the web

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add confidence score to predictions  
- Support uploading CSV input  
- Add model accuracy/visualizations in the app  
- Improve UI with more interactivity
